        <h2> Dogs Help Reduce Stress <h2>
        <p>Playing with or petting an animal can increase levels of the stress-reducing
           hormone oxytocin and decrease production of the stress hormone cortisol. These
            hormonal changes can help a nervous child feel more relaxed about reading
            aloud. Reduced stress can also benefit physical health. In a 2001 study,
          researchers found that pet-owning patients with high blood pressure could keep
          their blood pressure lower during times of mental stress than patients without pets</p>

        <h2> They Improve Our Health  <h2>
        <p>  One study of more than 2,000 adults found that regular dog
           walkers got more exercise and were less likely to be obese than
           those who didn't walk a dog. In another study, older dog walkers
           (ages 71-82) walked faster and longer than non-pooch-walkers, plus
           they were more mobile at home. </p>

        <p>They can always sense when something is wrong with you,
           and they will try their hardest to try to make you smile.
            What's better than having a snuggly pup willing to cheer you up when
            you're feeling down? </p>

        <h2> They Give Unconditional Love <h2>
        <p>No matter what you are going through, you can count on
           your dog's unconditional love and devotion. You are your
           dog's whole life. They would do anything for you. No matter what,
           the animal that you have bonded with will always love you and
           remember you. Even if you cannot return that unconditional love,
           just knowing that it is there will make your life better.  </p>
